This repo contains the whole Xcode project for iOS implementation.

The iOS applicaiton uses Multipeer Connectiviy Framework establishing local connections using combination of Bluetooth and WiFi.

The range of such connections varies over different iPhone models. Test results show better range of connection can be achieved using more advanced iPhone. Longest range achieved in tests is approximate 100 ft using iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 plus.
